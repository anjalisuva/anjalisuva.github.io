Hello! My name is Anjali Suva and I am a student at Pomona College majoring in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. I am interested in working at the intersection of data science and policy. This website showcases some projects that I've worked on using various open-source data sets. In these projects, I've handled data transformations, visualizations, and permutation in R, and I've also explored data wrangling with SQL. Feel free to take a look around my site!
