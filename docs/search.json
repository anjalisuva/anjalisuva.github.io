The graph implies that the most recorded encounters within this time period took place in 2023, with more than 12500 encounters recorded. By simply glancing at the graph, I am compelled to conclude that the greatest proportion of encounters took place in the region(s) that belong to the “Other” category. Unfortunately, since the data is limited, we do not know what these specific areas may be.\nTo check the regional proportions more accurately, I created the graph below. This takes the bar graph above but sets the y-axis to display the proportion of encounters rather than the raw count. In this graph, it is easier to identify details specific to each region. For example, 2021 is the year where the Southwest Land Border had the greatest proportion of encounters relative to other years, and 2023/2024 are the year(s) where the Northwest Land Border had the greatest proportion of encounters relative to other years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits:\nData: TidyTuesday U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Encounter Data, https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-11-26/readme.md\nOriginal Source: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, https://www.cbp.gov/document/stats/nationwide-encounters"

    "text": "# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  number film            release_date run_time film_rating\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;date&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      \n1      1 Toy Story       1995-11-22         81 G          \n2      2 A Bug's Life    1998-11-25         95 G          \n3      3 Toy Story 2     1999-11-24         92 G          \n4      4 Monsters, Inc.  2001-11-02         92 G          \n5      5 Finding Nemo    2003-05-30        100 G          \n6      6 The Incredibles 2004-11-05        115 PG         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this boxplot, I wanted to view the distribution of run times for Pixar films and see how long most Pixar films were. I chose to create a boxplot since I was only interested in one variable (the run time). According to the boxplot, the median run time was around 100 minutes, with 2 films as outliers. The graph is skewed to the right as a result.\nI wanted to know what the values were for the median and the first and third quartile, so I tried to wrangle the data to get the summary statistics. The tibble below shows what I found:\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  average_runtime    Q1    Q3\n            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1             100    95   106\n\n\nI also wanted to see what films were the two potential outliers. To do this, I created code for a data frame using the mutate function that would alert me to any outliers if the film’s run time was over 120 minutes, a metric I obtained from the boxplot above. The tibble is shown below. One of the outliers was Luca, with a run time of 151 minutes. The other film was unknown from the data set, but after some research done using the info in the release_date column, I found out that the film was Elemental.\n\n\n# A tibble: 27 × 4\n   film            run_time release_date potential_outlier\n   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;            \n 1 Luca                 151 2021-06-18   Yes              \n 2 &lt;NA&gt;                 155 2023-06-16   Yes              \n 3 Toy Story             81 1995-11-22   No               \n 4 A Bug's Life          95 1998-11-25   No               \n 5 Toy Story 2           92 1999-11-24   No               \n 6 Monsters, Inc.        92 2001-11-02   No               \n 7 Finding Nemo         100 2003-05-30   No               \n 8 The Incredibles      115 2004-11-05   No               \n 9 Cars                 117 2006-06-09   No               \n10 Ratatouille          111 2007-06-29   No               \n# ℹ 17 more rows\n\n\nCredits:\nData: TidyTuesday Pixar Films, https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-03-11/readme.md\nOriginal Source: pixarfilms R package by Eric Leung, drawing data from Wikipedia and OMDb, https://github.com/erictleung/pixarfilms"
