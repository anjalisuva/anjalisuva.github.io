I chose to create a boxplot since I was only interested in one variable (the run time). According to the boxplot, the median run time was around 100 minutes, with 2 films as outliers. The graph is skewed to the right as a result.\nI wanted to know what the values were for the median and the first and third quartile, so I tried to wrangle the data to get the summary statistics. The tibble below shows what I found:\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  average_runtime    Q1    Q3\n            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1             100    95   106\n\n\nI also wanted to see what films were the two potential outliers. To do this, I created code for a data frame using the mutate function that would alert me to any outliers if the film’s run time was over 120 minutes, a metric I obtained from the boxplot above. The tibble is shown below. One of the outliers was Luca, with a run time of 151 minutes. The other film was unknown from the data set, but after some research done using the info in the release_date column, I found out that the film was Elemental.\n\n\n# A tibble: 27 × 4\n   film            run_time release_date potential_outlier\n   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;            \n 1 Luca                 151 2021-06-18   Yes              \n 2 &lt;NA&gt;                 155 2023-06-16   Yes              \n 3 Toy Story             81 1995-11-22   No               \n 4 A Bug's Life          95 1998-11-25   No               \n 5 Toy Story 2           92 1999-11-24   No               \n 6 Monsters, Inc.        92 2001-11-02   No               \n 7 Finding Nemo         100 2003-05-30   No               \n 8 The Incredibles      115 2004-11-05   No               \n 9 Cars                 117 2006-06-09   No               \n10 Ratatouille          111 2007-06-29   No               \n# ℹ 17 more rows\n\n\nCredits:\nData: TidyTuesday issue #812, Pixar Films, https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-03-11/readme.md\nOriginal Source: pixarfilms R package by Eric Leung, drawing data from Wikipedia and OMDb, https://github.com/erictleung/pixarfilms"
