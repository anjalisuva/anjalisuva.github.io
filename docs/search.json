For my first question, I wanted to investigate whether or not the average length of NY Times article titles has changed over time.\nIn order to do this analysis, I used str_length to obtain the number of characters in each article title.\n\n\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n\nAvgTitleLength &lt;- NYTimes |&gt;\n  mutate(TitleLength = str_length(Title), \n         Year = year(dmy(Date))) |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarize(AvgTitleLength = mean(TitleLength)) |&gt;\n  select(Year, AvgTitleLength)\n\nas_tibble(AvgTitleLength)\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 2\n    Year AvgTitleLength\n   &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1996           53.1\n 2  1997           45.8\n 3  1998           40.7\n 4  1999           42.5\n 5  2000           54.0\n 6  2001           54.6\n 7  2002           46.4\n 8  2003           56.9\n 9  2004           48  \n10  2005           48.4\n11  2006           46.3\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(AvgTitleLength, aes(x = Year, y = AvgTitleLength)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"Average NYTimes Article Title Length by Year\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Title Length (in characters)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph above, it is clear that there is not much of a trend in the average title length over time. From 1996 to 2005, the average length of NYTimes article titles have been between 40 to 57 characters. The average length tends to fluctuate by each year, but there aren’t enough years in the data set to identify a concrete downward trend in the length of the titles.\nTaking the limited sample size for year into account, I wanted to search for something more specific—a trend that was more likely to show up on a graph. Since the years included on the dataset were from the range 1996-2005, I was interested in the number of times “Iraq” was mentioned in a headline, considering that the Iraq War began in 2003. I predict that there would be a sharp upturn in the number of times Iraq was mentioned after 2001, with 2003 being the year when it was mentioned the most.\nIn order to do this analysis, I used str_detect along with the regular expression (?i) to account for capitalized vs. non-capitalized headlines in the dataset.\n\nIraqHeadlines &lt;- NYTimes |&gt; \n  mutate(Year = year(dmy(Date))) |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarize(IraqinTitle = sum(str_detect(Title, \"(?i)Iraq\"))) |&gt;\n  select(Year, IraqinTitle)\n\nas_tibble(IraqHeadlines)\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 2\n    Year IraqinTitle\n   &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1  1996           1\n 2  1997           2\n 3  1998           5\n 4  1999           2\n 5  2000           0\n 6  2001           1\n 7  2002          16\n 8  2003          41\n 9  2004          38\n10  2005          22\n11  2006          24\n\n\n\nggplot(IraqHeadlines, aes(x = Year, y = IraqinTitle)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Times \\\"Iraq\\\" Appeared in Headline by Year\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Times \\\"Iraq\\\" Appeared in Headline\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the graph, there is a distinct increase in the number of times “Iraq” appears within the plot after 2001. In accordance with my prediction, the year with the greatest number of times Iraq appeared in the headline of a NYTimes article was 2003.\nSince the previous plot yielded expected results, I wondered how else I could utilize key words within the data set. While parsing through some of the headlines in the original NYTimes dataset, I noticed that certain titles would begin with a key word/phrase and a colon. For example, take this title from the dataset, “CRASH IN THE BALKANS: THE RESCUE; A Storm-Swept Mountain’s Grim Story.” The phrase “CRASH IN THE BALKANS” serves as a signifier to introduce the main subject matter of the story. I wanted to see how many of these key words or phrases existed within the data set.\nTo do this analysis, I used str_detect to filter for rows with colons and str_extract with a lookahead to extract the key phrases I wanted.\n\nKeyPhrasesinTitle &lt;- NYTimes |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(Title, \":\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(KeyPhrase = str_extract(Title, \".+(?=:)\")) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(KeyPhrase)) |&gt;\n  group_by(KeyPhrase) |&gt;\n  summarize(KeyPhraseTotal = n()) |&gt;\n  select(KeyPhrase, KeyPhraseTotal) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(KeyPhraseTotal))\n\n\nas_tibble(KeyPhrasesinTitle)\n\n# A tibble: 265 × 2\n   KeyPhrase              KeyPhraseTotal\n   &lt;chr&gt;                           &lt;int&gt;\n 1 A Nation Challenged                45\n 2 THE 2000 CAMPAIGN                  32\n 3 POLITICS                           21\n 4 THREATS AND RESPONSES              20\n 5 A NATION AT WAR                    17\n 6 CRISIS IN THE BALKANS              15\n 7 TESTING OF A PRESIDENT             15\n 8 AFTER THE WAR                       9\n 9 AFTEREFFECTS                        8\n10 THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ               7\n# ℹ 255 more rows\n\n\nAccording to the dataset, there are 265 key phrases that exist within the titles of the articles. The most common is “A Nation Challenged” with 45 instances of it in the dataset. This is followed by “THE 2000 CAMPAIGN”, which had 32 instances of it occurring.\nWhile examining the new table, I wondered if I could filter the data even more so I could find key words in the title (as opposed to phrases). For example “POLITICS” is one of the most common introductory words in the titles of articles, with 21 instances of it occurring.\nIn order to do this analysis, I slightly altered the code above to account for only words as opposed to words and phrases. To do this, I used the regular expressions of “^” and “\\w” to filter for rows that started with a word followed directly by a colon.\n\nKeyWordsinTitle &lt;- NYTimes |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(Title, \"^\\\\w+:\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(KeyWord = str_extract(Title, \"^\\\\w+(?=:)\")) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(KeyWord)) |&gt;\n  group_by(KeyWord) |&gt;\n  summarize(KeyWordTotal = n()) |&gt;\n  select(KeyWord, KeyWordTotal) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(KeyWordTotal))\n\n\nas_tibble(KeyWordsinTitle)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 2\n  KeyWord      KeyWordTotal\n  &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;int&gt;\n1 POLITICS               24\n2 AFTEREFFECTS            8\n3 IMPEACHMENT             3\n4 BASEBALL                2\n5 AFTEREFFECT             1\n6 SUNY                    1\n7 Trial                   1\n8 Wanted                  1\n\n\nAfter doing that, I was able to view the key introductory words that were used in the titles of the headlines, which fit neatly into this 8 row table. Unsurprisingly, the most popular key word was “POLITICS”, which was easily predictable simply by examining the previous table.\nCredits:\nData: RTextTools R package: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RTextTools\nOriginal Source: Headlines from The New York Times, compiled by Professor Amber E.

I chose to create a boxplot since I was only interested in one variable (the run time). According to the boxplot, the median run time was around 100 minutes, with 2 films as outliers. The graph is skewed to the right as a result.\nI wanted to know what the values were for the median and the first and third quartile, so I tried to wrangle the data to get the summary statistics. The tibble below shows what I found:\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  average_runtime    Q1    Q3\n            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1             100    95   106\n\n\nI also wanted to see what films were the two potential outliers. To do this, I created code for a data frame using the mutate function that would alert me to any outliers if the film’s run time was over 120 minutes, a metric I obtained from the boxplot above. The tibble is shown below. One of the outliers was Luca, with a run time of 151 minutes. The other film was unknown from the data set, but after some research done using the info in the release_date column, I found out that the film was Elemental.\n\n\n# A tibble: 27 × 4\n   film            run_time release_date potential_outlier\n   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;            \n 1 Luca                 151 2021-06-18   Yes              \n 2 &lt;NA&gt;                 155 2023-06-16   Yes              \n 3 Toy Story             81 1995-11-22   No               \n 4 A Bug's Life          95 1998-11-25   No               \n 5 Toy Story 2           92 1999-11-24   No               \n 6 Monsters, Inc.        92 2001-11-02   No               \n 7 Finding Nemo         100 2003-05-30   No               \n 8 The Incredibles      115 2004-11-05   No               \n 9 Cars                 117 2006-06-09   No               \n10 Ratatouille          111 2007-06-29   No               \n# ℹ 17 more rows\n\n\nCredits:\nData: TidyTuesday Pixar Films, https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-03-11/readme.md\nOriginal Source: pixarfilms R package by Eric Leung, drawing data from Wikipedia and OMDb, https://github.com/erictleung/pixarfilms"

The graph implies that the most recorded encounters within this time period took place in 2023, with more than 12500 encounters recorded. By simply glancing at the graph, I am compelled to conclude that the greatest proportion of encounters took place in the region(s) that belong to the “Other” category. Unfortunately, since the data is limited, we do not know what these specific areas may be.\nTo check the regional proportions more accurately, I created the graph below. This takes the bar graph above but sets the y-axis to display the proportion of encounters rather than the raw count. In this graph, it is easier to identify details specific to each region. For example, 2021 is the year where the Southwest Land Border had the greatest proportion of encounters relative to other years, and 2023/2024 are the year(s) where the Northwest Land Border had the greatest proportion of encounters relative to other years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits:\nData: TidyTuesday U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Encounter Data, https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-11-26/readme.md\nOriginal Source: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, https://www.cbp.gov/document/stats/nationwide-encounters"
